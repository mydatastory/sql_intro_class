A **relational database** is a way to store and manipulate information. Databases are arranged as **tables**. Each table has columns 
(also known as fields that describe the data, and rows (also known as **records** which contain the data.

When we are using a spreadsheet, we put formulas into cells to calculate new values based on old ones. When we are using a database, we send commands (usually called queries to a database manager), a program that manipulates the database for us. The database manager does whatever lookups and calculations the query specifies, returning the results in a tabular form that we can then use as a starting point for further queries.

Queries are written in a language called **SQL**, which stands for "Structured Query Language".
SQL provides hundreds of different ways to analyze and recombine data. We will only look at a handful of queries,
but that handful accounts for most of what scientists do.

> ## Changing Database Managers
>
> Many database managers --- Oracle,
> IBM DB2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft Access, and SQLite ---  understand
> SQL but each stores data in a different way,
> so a database created with one cannot be used directly by another.
> However, every database manager
> can import and export data in a variety of formats like .csv, SQL,
> so it *is* possible to move information from one to another.

> ## Getting Into and Out Of SQLite
>
> In order to use the SQLite commands *interactively*, we need to
> enter into the SQLite console.  So, open up a terminal, and run
>
> ~~~
> $ cd /path/to/survey/data/
> $ sqlite3 survey.db
> ~~~
> 
> The SQLite command is `sqlite3` and you are telling SQLite to open up
> the `survey.db`.  You need to specify the `.db` file otherwise, SQLite
> will open up a temporary, empty database.
>
> To get out of SQLite, type out `.exit` or `.quit`.  For some
> terminals, `Ctrl-D` can also work.  If you forget any SQLite `.` (dot)
> command, type `.help`.

Before we get into using SQLite to select the data, let's take a look at the tables of the database we will use in our examples:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">

**Person**: people who took readings.

|id      |personal |family
|--------|---------|----------
|dyer    |William  |Dyer
|pb      |Frank    |Pabodie
|lake    |Anderson |Lake
|roe     |Valentina|Roerich
|danforth|Frank    |Danforth

**Site**: locations where readings were taken.

|name |lat   |long   |
|-----|------|-------|
|DR-1 |-49.85|-128.57|
|DR-3 |-47.15|-126.72|
|MSK-4|-48.87|-123.4 |

**Visited**: when readings were taken at specific sites.

|id   |site |dated     |
|-----|-----|----------|
|619  |DR-1 |1927-02-08|
|622  |DR-1 |1927-02-10|
|734  |DR-3 |1930-01-07|
|735  |DR-3 |1930-01-12|
|751  |DR-3 |1930-02-26|
|752  |DR-3 |-null-    |
|837  |MSK-4|1932-01-14|
|844  |DR-1 |1932-03-22|

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">

**Survey**: the actual readings.  The field `quant` is short for quantitative and indicates what is being measured.  Values are `rad`, `sal`, and `temp` referring to 'radiation', 'salinity' and 'temperature', respectively.

|taken|person|quant|reading|
|-----|------|-----|-------|
|619  |dyer  |rad  |9.82   |
|619  |dyer  |sal  |0.13   |
|622  |dyer  |rad  |7.8    |
|622  |dyer  |sal  |0.09   |

|837  |roe   |sal  |22.5   |
|844  |roe   |rad  |11.25  |

Notice that three entries --- one in the `Visited` table,
and two in the `Survey` table --- don't contain any actual
data, but instead have a special `-null-` entry:
we'll return to these missing values [later]({{ site.github.url }}/05-null/).

For now, let's write an SQL query that displays scientists' names.
We do this using the SQL command `SELECT`, giving it the names of the columns we want and the table we want them from.
Our query and its output look like this:

~~~
SELECT family, personal FROM Person;
~~~
{: .sql}

|family  |personal |
|--------|---------|
|Dyer    |William  |
|Pabodie |Frank    |
|Lake    |Anderson |
|Roerich |Valentina|
|Danforth|Frank    |

The semicolon at the end of the query
tells the database manager that the query is complete and ready to run.
We have written our commands in upper case and the names for the table and columns
in lower case,
but we don't have to:
as the example below shows,
SQL is **case insensitive**.

~~~
SeLeCt FaMiLy, PeRsOnAl FrOm PeRsOn;
~~~
{: .sql}

|family  |personal |
|--------|---------|
|Dyer    |William  |
|Pabodie |Frank    |
|Lake    |Anderson |
|Roerich |Valentina|
|Danforth|Frank    |

You can use SQL's case insensitivity to your advantage. For instance,
some people choose to write SQL keywords (such as `SELECT` and `FROM`)
in capital letters and **field** and **table** names in lower
case. This can make it easier to locate parts of an SQL statement. For
instance, you can scan the statement, quickly locate the prominent
`FROM` keyword and know the table name follows.  Whatever casing
convention you choose, please be consistent: complex queries are hard
enough to read without the extra cognitive load of random
capitalization.  One convention is to use UPPER CASE for SQL
statements, to distinguish them from tables and column names. This is
the convention that we will use for this lesson.

While we are on the topic of SQL's syntax, one aspect of SQL's syntax
that can frustrate novices and experts alike is forgetting to finish a
command with `;` (semicolon).  When you press enter for a command
without adding the `;` to the end, it can look something like this:

~~~
SELECT id FROM Person
...>
...>
~~~
{: .sql}

This is SQL's prompt, where it is waiting for additional commands or
for a `;` to let SQL know to finish.  This is easy to fix!  Just type
`;` and press enter!

Now, going back to our query,
it's important to understand that
the rows and columns in a database table aren't actually stored in any particular order.
They will always be *displayed* in some order,
but we can control that in various ways.
For example,
we could swap the columns in the output by writing our query as:

~~~
SELECT personal, family FROM Person;
~~~
{: .sql}

|personal |family  |
|---------|--------|
|William  |Dyer    |
|Frank    |Pabodie |
|Anderson |Lake    |
|Valentina|Roerich |
|Frank    |Danforth|

or even repeat columns:

~~~
SELECT id, id, id FROM Person;
~~~
{: .sql}

|id      |id      |id      |
|--------|--------|--------|
|dyer    |dyer    |dyer    |
|pb      |pb      |pb      |
|lake    |lake    |lake    |
|roe     |roe     |roe     |
|danforth|danforth|danforth|

As a shortcut,
we can select all of the columns in a table using `*`:

~~~
SELECT * FROM Person;
~~~
{: .sql}

|id      |personal |family  |
|--------|---------|--------|
|dyer    |William  |Dyer    |
|pb      |Frank    |Pabodie |
|lake    |Anderson |Lake    |
|roe     |Valentina|Roerich |
|danforth|Frank    |Danforth|
